Notes,,,,
,,,,
When the centre operates a Kindergarten or preschool centre only and is only open during school hours and term times I have listed it as 'Short Day Care' in 'Type of Care' field,,,,
"When I have put a '*' at the end of the 'Type of Care' field, this indicates that the centre also provides a Vacation Care program",,,,
"As a matter of interest, all C&K Kindergartens operate individually, i.e. They do not have a standard price, opening times or enrolment procedures, they are all different",,,,
"For all Before School Care and After School care centres, I have listed them as 'Outside Hours Care' in the 'Type of Care column.",,,,
"For some family day care centres I have listed an '*' within the fees column, this is because the fee is listed 'per hour' instead of 'per day'",,,,
"One thing I believe should be recorded that isnt on the spreadsheet, is if the centre offeres an approved Kindergarten Program (Kindergarten QLD tick of approval, qualified teachers etc)",,,,
"For the occasional Kindergarten program the fees are only listed per term, not per day. In this case I have listed as '36 months - 4 years: $1118.00 per term*""",,,,
